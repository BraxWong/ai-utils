// Usage:
//
// class MyClass : public AIRefCount
// {
// };
//
// int main()
// {
//   boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> my_class = new MyClass;      // m_count = 1
//   {
//     MyClass* p = my_class.get();
//     boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> ip(p);                     // m_count = 2
//   }                                                          // m_count = 1
//   my_class->print();
// }                                                            // m_count = 0 --> destruction of MyClass.
//
//
// Note 1
//
// If one wishes to make sure that an object is (temporarily) not deleted,
// but cannot use a boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> because there is no scope
// where it can be created and destructed, then do NOT call
// intrusive_ptr_add_ref(ptr) / intrusive_ptr_release(ptr)
// as a pair to achieve that.
//
// Instead, use ptr->inhibit_deletion() / ptr->allow_deletion() as a pair.
//
//
// Note 2
//
// An object that is derived from AIRefCount should only ever be created on the
// heap, aka by a call to new. If the resulting pointer is not passed a
// boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> then the reference counter m_count remains zero.
// This means that most of the API cannot be used anymore.
//
// The only member function that is still guaranteed to work is the debug
// function is_destructed().
//
// On the other hand; it is allowed to "fake" a boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass>
// by simply calling intrusive_ptr_add_ref() after creation. In that case
// everything works as expected, except that the object can be 'released'
// by doing a call to intrusive_ptr_release() (once!).
//
// In other words, the following is allowed:
//
//   MyClass* ptr = new MyClass;        // m_count = 0
//   intrusive_ptr_add_ref(ptr);        // m_count = 1
//
// And then later, somewhere else, do:
//
//   intrusive_ptr_release(ptr);        // Cancel initial call to intrusive_ptr_add_ref.
//                                      // This *might* cause ptr to be destructed immediately.

// Forward declare intrusive_ptr_add_ref and intrusive_ptr_release because
// that gives a much clearer compile error on g++ when the class used in
// a boost::intrusive_ptr was only forward declared (and not fully defined)
// at the point the boost::intrusive_ptr is being used.

    // Because m_count is overwritten with s_deleted upon destruction when CWDEBUG is defined, a reference count of
    // zero means that this object is probably still being constructed and wasn't passed to a boost::intrusive_ptr _yet_.
    // If under those circumstances an intrusive_ptr_add_ref/intrusive_ptr_release pair,
    // that is merely intended to temporarily inhibit deletion, could inadvertently delete
    // the object while it is still being constructed (at least, before we even got
    // the chance to pass it to the first boost::intrusive_ptr).
    // This test can help in detecting that it was not a good idea to call inhibit_deletion
    // if that can result in a subsequent call to allow_deletion() before that first
    // boost::intrusive_ptr is created. If that is not possible then you can pass
    // false to this function.
    //
    // Normally, when this assert fires you should find the function that was
    // called from the constructor of the derived class that caused inhibit_deletion
    // to be called, and delay that call to after you have a boost::intrusive_ptr.
    //
    // For example,
    //
    // struct A : public AIRefCount {
    //   void f() { inhibit_deletion(); }
    //   A() { f(); }
    // };
    //
    // boost::intrusive_ptr<A> p = new A;
    //
    // Should become,
    //
    // struct A : public AIRefCount {
    //   void f() { inhibit_deletion(); }
    //   A() { }
    // };
    //
    // boost::intrusive_ptr<A> p = new A;
    // p->f();
    //
    // If you are using the evio submodule and this object is derived from evio::FileDescriptor
    // then you probably created a device without assigning it to a boost::intrusive_ptr at all
    // (e.g: MyDevice my_device;) Don't do that. Devices should be created like:
    //
    // auto my_device = evio::create<MyDevice>(/* device constructor arguments */);
