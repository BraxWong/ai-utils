// Lock-free ring buffer for trivially copyable objects, to be written and
// read (using std::memcpy) in chunks of (a fixed) T_per_chunk objects at a time.
//
// In most cases T will be a pointer; but it can be anything else that
// is trivially copyable (can be moved around using memcpy);
//
//  _ _ _ _________________________________________ _ _ _ _
// G | HH | AA | BB | CC | DD | EE | FF | GG | HH | AA | BB

//     end/begin  m_head   m_tail   m_readptr  end/begin
//     m_buffer
//
// The pointers, m_head, m_tail and m_readptr, move from left to right; but cannot overtake eachother.
// If they pass the end, they wrap around to the beginning again. m_tail can become equal to m_readptr,
// which can become equal to m_head (buffer empty); but m_head can't advance beyond one place before
// m_tail at which point the buffer is full.
//
// Next to be overwritten: CC ; Next returned to be read: GG ; Still waiting to be copied and popped: EE and FF.
//
// push()/push_zero()
// If the distance between head and tail is at least two chunks (it is precisely two in the image), then a
// call to push() copies one chunk to m_head and then advances m_head one position (so that it will never
// become equal to m_tail). Note that when m_head equals m_tail, then the buffer is empty.
// push_zero() does the same but writes zeroes using memset instead of copying data provided by the caller.
// Both Return true if the operation succeeded, false if the buffer is full.
//
// pop()
// Return the current position of m_tail and advance it one chunk. Because push() never overwrites the
// chunk left of m_tail it is still safe to read that chunk until the next call to pop() (this class only
// allows ONE producer thread and ONE consumer thread!) Returns nullptr if the buffer is empty.
//
// read()
// Return the current position of m_readptr and advance it one chunk. Returns nullptr if there is nothing
// more to read. This function can be used to peek if there is anything left without actually reading it
// (when reading from pop()), or to get the next chunk without destructing the data that the pointer
// returned last by pop() (or read()) is pointing to.
//
// reset_readptr()
// Move m_readptr back to where m_tail is.
//
// clear()
// Empty the buffer (sets m_tail and m_readptr to where m_head is).
